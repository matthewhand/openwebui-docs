# Enabling HTTPS Encryption for Open WebUI

**Note:** HTTPS encryption is **not required** to operate Open WebUI in most cases. However, certain features—such as **Voice Calls**—will be blocked by modern web browsers unless HTTPS is enabled. If you do not plan to use these features, you can skip this section.

This guide provides instructions for setting up **HTTPS encryption** using a reverse proxy. While **Nginx** is used as an example, other proxies such as **Traefik** or **Caddy** can also be configured similarly. This setup assumes a **Docker Compose deployment** for compatibility.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose are installed.
- Open WebUI is already deployed and running.
- Basic understanding of reverse proxy configuration.

### Overview

This example demonstrates setting up **Nginx** as a reverse proxy to enable HTTPS for Open WebUI. It uses **self-signed certificates** for simplicity, but you can substitute trusted certificates if required.

---

## Nginx Configuration Files

1. **Create directories for Nginx files:**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p nginx/conf.d nginx/ssl
   ```

2. **Create the Nginx configuration files:**

**`nginx/conf.d/open-webui.conf`**:
```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name open-webui;

    ssl_certificate /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.crt;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/nginx/ssl/nginx.key;
    ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://host.docker.internal:3000;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }
}
```

**`nginx/nginx.conf`**:
```nginx
user nginx;
worker_processes auto;
error_log /var/log/nginx/error.log warn;
pid /var/run/nginx.pid;

events {
    worker_connections 1024;
}

http {
    include /etc/nginx/mime.types;
    default_type application/octet-stream;

    log_format main "$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local] \"$request\" "
                    "$status $body_bytes_sent \"$http_referer\" "
                    "\"$http_user_agent\" \"$http_x_forwarded_for\"";
    access_log /var/log/nginx/access.log main;

    sendfile on;
    tcp_nopush on;
    tcp_nodelay on;
    keepalive_timeout 65;
    types_hash_max_size 2048;

    include /etc/nginx/conf.d/*.conf;
}
```

## Docker Compose Configuration for Nginx

Use the following **Docker Compose** configuration to deploy Nginx with Open WebUI:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:alpine
    container_name: nginx_forwarding
    ports:
      - "443:443"
    volumes:
      - ./nginx.conf:/etc/nginx/nginx.conf
      - ./conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d
      - ./ssl:/etc/nginx/ssl
    restart: unless-stopped
```

---

## Self-Signed Certificates Setup

The following configuration demonstrates how to generate and use **self-signed SSL certificates**.  
Note: **Self-signed certificates are not trusted by browsers by default**.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  nginx:
    image: nginx:latest
    container_name: nginx-proxy
    networks: ['demo']
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - 443:443
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/certs:/etc/nginx/certs
      - ./nginx/conf.d:/etc/nginx/conf.d
    depends_on:
      - nginx-init
    command: >
      /bin/sh -c "sleep 5 && nginx -g 'daemon off;'"
    environment:
      - NGINX_HOST=open-webui

  nginx-init:
    image: alpine
    container_name: nginx-init
    networks: ['demo']
    volumes:
      - ./nginx/certs:/etc/nginx/certs
    entrypoint: /bin/sh
    command:
      - "-c"
      - |
        apk add --no-cache openssl && \
        mkdir -p /etc/nginx/certs && \
        openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
        -keyout /etc/nginx/certs/selfsigned.key \
        -out /etc/nginx/certs/selfsigned.crt \
        -subj "/CN=open-webui"
```

## Optional: Extending the HTTPS Setup

While this guide provides a basic example using **Nginx** with self-signed certificates, the same concepts apply to other reverse proxies like **Traefik** or **Caddy**. You can also:

- Use **trusted certificates** from a certificate authority (CA).
- Secure additional services by creating more configuration files within the `conf.d/` directory.
- Configure **DNS-based routing** for multiple services.

---

## Troubleshooting Tips

### 1. Browser Warnings for Self-Signed Certificates  
Browsers will display warnings for self-signed certificates. To bypass this:

- **In Chrome**: Click on "Advanced" and proceed.
- **In Firefox**: Add an exception manually.

For production environments, consider using trusted certificates from a CA to avoid these warnings.

### 2. Verify Open WebUI Availability  
After configuring HTTPS, ensure Open WebUI is accessible by navigating to:  
`https://localhost:443` or `https://<your-domain>`

If there are issues, verify:

- **Firewall Rules**: Ensure port **443** is open.
- **Nginx Logs**: Check `access.log` and `error.log` under `/var/log/nginx/`.

### 3. Restart Containers After Configuration Changes  
If any configuration files are modified, restart the Nginx container:

```bash
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```

## Conclusion

This guide demonstrates how to enable **HTTPS encryption** for Open WebUI using Nginx as an example. This setup ensures secure communication and unlocks features like **Voice Calls**, which require HTTPS to function in modern browsers.
