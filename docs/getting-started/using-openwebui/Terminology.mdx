# ðŸ“– OpenWebUI Terminology

Understand key concepts and components within OpenWebUI to enhance your usage and configuration.

---

## Models  
These are pre-trained machine learning models that perform specific tasks, such as natural language generation (e.g., Llama 3.2). Models can be managed locally or remotely and configured through Ollama.

---

## Prompts  
Prompts are inputs provided by the user to guide the modelâ€™s response. Effective prompts are essential for generating meaningful outputs from the model.

---

## Knowledge Bases  
Knowledge stores are collections of relevant documents and data that the model can query during conversations. With **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, the model retrieves useful information from the store.

---

## Functions  
Functions allow OpenWebUI to interact with external services, databases, or custom code within workflows. They extend the capabilities of the LLM.

---

## Pipes  
Pipes are used to connect different actions or services sequentially, passing the output of one step as the input to the next.

---

## Actions  
Actions trigger specific behaviors in the system, like running a query, sending a message, or generating content. Actions can be automated using workflows.

This terminology guide will help you navigate and configure OpenWebUI effectively!
