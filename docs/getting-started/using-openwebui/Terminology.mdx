# ðŸ“– OpenWebUI Terminology

Enhance your understanding of OpenWebUI with key concepts and components to improve your usage and configuration.

---

## Explore the Workspace  
Begin by exploring the [Workspace](../../tutorials/features/workspace) to discover essential concepts such as Modelfiles, Knowledge, Prompts, Tools, and Functions.

---

## Interact with the Playground  
Visit the Playground to directly engage with a Large Language Model. Here, you can experiment with different `System Prompts` to modify the model's behavior and persona.

---

## Customize in Settings  
Access the Settings to personalize your experience. Customize features like Memory, adjust Voice settings for both TTS (Text-to-Speech) and STT (Speech-to-Text), and toggle between Dark/Light mode for optimal viewing.

---

## Functions  
Functions allow OpenWebUI to interact with external services, databases, or custom code within workflows. They extend the capabilities of the LLM.

---

## Pipes  
Pipes are used to connect different actions or services sequentially, passing the output of one step as the input to the next.

---

## Actions  
Actions trigger specific behaviors in the system, like running a query, sending a message, or generating content. Actions can be automated using workflows.
