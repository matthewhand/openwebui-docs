# Overview of Functions and Tools in Open WebUI

Functions and tools in Open WebUI extend the capabilities of the platform and enhance the usability of Large Language Models (LLMs). These components allow for new functionality, customization, and integration with external data sources.

## 🧰 Tools

**Tools** provide **external abilities** that LLMs wouldn’t have by default, enabling them to gather **real-time data** or perform specialized tasks based on external input. 

### Examples of Tools:
- **Weather updates** 🛰️  
- **Stock price retrievers** 📈  
- **Flight tracking** ✈️  

Tools act as **plugins**, allowing the AI to interact with the real world during conversations by gathering real-time information.

## 🔧 Functions

**Functions** extend the **core WebUI** itself, allowing customization of the interface or behavior. While tools extend the AI’s external abilities, functions focus on improving or expanding the WebUI’s **internal logic and features**.

### Examples of Functions:
1. **Adding new models** (like Anthropic or Vertex AI).
2. **Creating custom buttons** for frequently used tasks.
3. **Implementing filters** for spam or inappropriate messages.

Functions allow users to **tailor the WebUI platform**, making it more efficient and suited to specific needs.

## 🔄 Configuration with Valves

**Valves** and **UserValves** are components used to configure dynamic settings like **API keys** or feature toggles.  
- **Valves**: Managed by administrators.  
- **UserValves**: Configurable by end-users for personal settings.

## 📋 Summary of Components:
- **Tools**: Allow LLMs to **interact with external systems** and gather real-time data.
- **Functions**: Enable customization of the **Open WebUI platform** for better usability or new features.
- **Valves**: Provide flexible configuration options for both admins and users.

## 📊 Pipelines

**Pipelines** transform the WebUI's features into **API-compatible workflows**. They are used for advanced cases where heavy processing needs to be offloaded to another system.

## 🛠️ Suggestions for Improvement

- Expanding documentation with **examples** and **best practices**.
- Renaming this section to "Open WebUI Functionality Guide" to clarify its purpose.
